       "[Document(metadata={'source': '../data/DiseaseText.txt'}, page_content=', GIARDIASIS\\nGiardiasis is an intestinal illness caused by Giardia lamblia, a microscopic parasite. The infectious form of the parasite is passed in the stool of an infected individual.\\nWho gets this disease?\\nAnyone can get Giardiasis. It is very common in childcare centers; especially those that have children under age three. It spreads easily among these children to their caretakers and families.\\nHow is it spread?\\nThe most common way a person becomes infected with giardia in the childcare setting is by the fecal-oral route. Eating food contaminated with the parasite may also infect a person. Food may become contaminated when the person preparing the food has giardiasis and has some infected stool on his/her hands because of poor hand washing habits.\\nAdditionally, a person may become infected by drinking water that is contaminated with the parasite. Streams, ponds and springs in New Hampshire are frequently contaminated with giardiasis parasites. Water can also be contaminated with giardia when sewage enters the drinking water supply.\\nWhat are the symptoms?\\nThe most common symptoms of a giardia infection are diarrhea, abdominal pain, cramping, decreased appetite and excess gas. There is usually no fever or vomiting. The diarrhea may last up to several months and can cause significant weight loss.\\nHow soon do the symptoms appear?\\nThe symptoms appear within 5-25 days or longer. The average incubation period is 1-3 weeks.\\nCan a person have this disease without knowing it?\\nYes. Some people may have very mild infections that are not serious enough to cause them to go to a doctor. They may not feel sick at all. In some cases of giardia infection, parasites can be found in the stool from several days to several months after the symptoms have stopped.\\nWhat is the treatment?\\nSeveral drugs are effective in killing the giardia parasite. Treatment is usually necessary for persons with diarrhea.\\nHow can the spread of this disease be prevented?\\n1. Wash hands thoroughly after using the toilet and diapering a child.\\n2. Wash hands thoroughly before preparing food.\\n3. Keep children who have diarrhea at home.\\n4. Staff with stool positive for giardia should not prepare food or feed children.\\nWho should be excluded?\\nAny person with diarrhea shall be excluded from food handling, from childcare agencies and from direct care of hospitalized or institutionalized patients until 48 hours after resolution of symptoms\\nReportable?\\nYes, giardiasis is reportable by New Hampshire law to the Division of Public Health Services, Bureau of Infectious Disease Control at (603) 271-4496\\n\\nbacterium that causes serious, sometimes fatal illnesses, most often in young children. Some of the diseases it can cause include: meningitis (an infection of the coverings of the brain), epiglottitis (an infection of the upper throat and entrance of the windpipe), cellulitis (an infection of the deep tissues, especially of the face and neck), septic arthritis (an infection and swelling of the joints), pneumonia (an infection of the lung), and bacteremia (blood stream) infections.\\nWho gets this disease?\\nThis illness is primarily seen in unimmunized children under four years of age. Children under age two are most susceptible because their immune systems are not yet able to fight the bacteria. Rarely, older children and adults may develop infection.\\nIt appears that in a setting such as the household or childcare facility – where there are young children and everyone is in close contact – there is an increased risk of one of these contacts developing Hib infection following a first case.\\nHow is it spread?\\nThe bacterium is passed from person-to-person by breathing in infected droplets of nose or throat fluids scattered in the air or by direct contact with these infected secretions. The bacteria cannot live on environmental surfaces – they quickly shrivel and die.\\nLike meningococcus, some people can “carry” this bacterium for a period of time without it causing illness. However, a carrier may spread the bacteria to another person who may then become ill. In a household or childcare center in which Hib infection has occurred, the number of persons with nose or throat carriage is greatly increased; thus, risk of serious disease is also increased.\\nHow is it diagnosed and treated?\\nIllnesses caused by Haemophilus influenzae type-b are diagnosed by signs and symptoms and by examining the blood and/or spinal fluid for white blood cells and bacteria. Spinal fluid is obtained by a physician performing a lumbar puncture (i.e., spinal tap).\\nHow can the spread of this disease be prevented?\\n1. If a person develops an illness caused by Hib, close contacts of this patient (including family members and persons having intimate contact such as sleeping together, hugging and kissing) are at increased risk of developing the illness. In this situation a physician may recommend: 1) carefully watching for early symptoms of illness caused by Haemophilus influenzae and/or 2) taking a preventive antibiotic to eliminate the bacteria from the body before disease begins.\\n2. Any child or adult contact that develops symptoms consistent with Hib infection requires evaluation by a heath care provider regardless of whether or not this person has taken preventive antibiotics.\\n3. A vaccination against Hib infection is available and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all children begin the vaccine series against Hib infection at two months of age. The four dose series should be completed at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12-15 months.disease is an illness caused by a virus called human parvovirus B19. Although people may be asymptomatic with the illness, most children with it develop a facial rash (i.e., “slapped check” appearance) and a lace-like rash on the trunk and extremities. The rash may reappear for several weeks following exposure to non-specific stimuli such as sunlight, change in temperature or emotional stress.\\nExcept for the rash, the patient is typically otherwise well: but some give a history of mild general symptoms one to four days before rash onset. Fever, sore throat or pain and swelling in the joints may also occur.\\nWho gets this disease?\\nAlthough most commonly recognized in children, anyone is susceptible. Studies indicate previous infection with Fifth disease correlates with a lower risk of a second infection. Outbreaks in schools often begin in late winter or early spring and may continue until the school year is over.\\nIn the U.S. about 50% of the adult population are already immune to the disease. Some studies indicate the pregnant women who are exposed to Fifth disease and subsequently develop infection may have an increased risk for fetal death. However, this risk is felt to be extremely low. There is no evidence that the infection during pregnancy causes fetal malformations (i.e., birth defects). Pregnant childcare workers should contact their obstetricians.\\nHow is it spread?\\nThe virus that causes Fifth disease has been found in the respiratory secretions of patients and is, therefore, most likely spread by direct person-to-person contact through the respiratory route.\\nHow soon do symptoms appear?\\nIt takes from 4-21 days after exposure to develop the characteristic rash illness of Fifth disease.\\nPeople with the rash are past the period of infectiousness to others. The highest risk of transmitting the Fifth disease virus to others is felt to occur before the rash develops.\\nHow is it diagnosed and treated?\\nA healthcare provider based on the characteristic rash and any other accompanying symptoms may diagnose Fifth disease. There is no specific treatment for Fifth disease.\\nHow can the spread of this disease be prevented?\\n1. Because transmission of the Fifth disease virus usually occurs before the rash develops – when a child may seem well or has a non-specific illness – excluding children with the Fifth disease rash is of no proven value. However, it is very important for a healthcare provider to rule out other rash-causing illnesses (e.g., measles, chickenpox) that may require exclusion from childcare.\\n2. Transmission of infection can be lessened by routine hygienic practices for control of respiratory infections, which include hand washing and disposal of facial tissues containing respiratory secretions.\\n3. People with particular concerns about contracting Fifth disease (e.g., pregnant women) should consult their healthcare providers.')]"

Then answer the quesƟ ons below. \\nDisease \\nA disease is a parƟ cular abnormal condiƟ on, a disorder of a structure or funcƟ on that aﬀ ects \\npart or all of an organism. The causal study of disease is called pathology. Disease is o Ō en \\nconstrued as a medical condi Ɵ on associated with speci ﬁ c symptoms and signs. It may be \\ncaused by factors originally from an external source, such as infecƟ ous disease, or it may be \\ncaused by internal dysfuncƟ ons, such as autoimmune diseases. Diseases usually aﬀ ect people \\nnot only physically, but also emoƟ onally, as contracƟ ng and living with a disease can alter one’s \\nperspecƟ ve on life, and one’s personality.\\nCommonly, the term disease is used to refer speci ﬁ cally to infec Ɵ ous diseases, which are \\nclinically evident diseases that result from the presence of pathogenic microbial agents, \\nincluding viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, mul Ɵ cellular organisms, and aberrant proteins \\nknown as prions. An infecƟ on that does not and will not produce clinically evident impairment \\nof normal funcƟ oning, such as the presence of the normal bacteria and yeasts in the gut, or of \\na passenger virus, is not considered a disease. By contrast, an infecƟ on that is asymptomaƟ c \\nduring its incubaƟ on period, but expected to produce symptoms later, is usually considered \\na disease. Non-infecƟ ous diseases are all other diseases, including most forms of cancer, heart \\ndisease, and geneƟ c disease.\\nAnswer the quesƟ ons below according to the text above \\n:\\n1. What is considered a disease and what is not considered a disease?\\n2. What are typical causes of disease? \\n3. How do diseases typically a ﬀ ect people?\\n4. What is the di ﬀ erence between infecƟ ous diseases and non-infecƟ ous diseases? \\nREADING 2\\nTHE STAGES OF DISEASE AND THEIR PECULIARITIES.

Which diseases do you remember from the 10 \\ndiseases named in the video? What do you know about these diseases? What makes them so dangerous?\\n10.  Polio. Targets the nervous system to cause spinal and respiratory paralysis. Spread through fecal remains, it mainly aﬀ ects young \\nchildren. \\n\\u20029.  Yellow Fever. Spread through infected mosquitos, it can lead to jaundice and organ failure. There are 200,000 cases each year, \\n30,000 of which prove fatal. \\n\\u20028.  Sars. OriginaƟ ng from China’s Guangdong region in 2002, the virus kills 1 in 10 infected. An airborne virus, it clogs the lungs lead-\\ning to respiratory failure. \\n\\u20027.  Spanish Flu. Fluids ﬁ ll vicƟ ms’ lungs, drowning them in their own mucus. The airborne virus killed 100million in 1918 – more than \\nhad died during WW1. \\n\\u20026.  Cholera. Causes diarrhea and vomiƟ ng, leading to dehydraƟ on, which can send the body into shock. Spread through contaminated \\nwater, there are an esƟ mated 120,000 deaths a year from cholera. \\n\\u20025.  Malaria. Causes seizures, comas and paƟ ents’ brains to swell. Carried by parasites spread through insect bites, it kills 1 child every \\nminute. \\n\\u20024.  Plague. Spread through ﬂ eas from infected animals. Kills 70% of vic Ɵ ms – some in 24 hours. Causes excrucia Ɵ ng swelling; the \\nMedieval plague killed up to 75 million worldwide. \\n\\u20023.  Ebola. Spread through contact with bodily ﬂ uid, hemorrhaging vicƟ ms die from blood loss. One of Earth’s most lethal diseases, \\nthere’s no cure and a 90% fatality rate. \\n\\u20022.  Tuberculosis. The world’s second biggest killer aƩ acks the lungs, bones and nervous system. Caught by inhaling airborne saliva, \\n1/3 of the world’s populaƟ on has latent TB. \\n\\u20021.  HIV. AƩ acks the immune system, making the vicƟ m unable to ﬁ ght oﬀ  infecƟ on. 35 million people are esƟ mated to be currently \\nliving with HIV. \\nLISTENING 2\\nListen to the radio broadcast about the types of diseases and ﬁ ll in the table below indicaƟ ng the 10 types of diseases named by \\nProfessor Livingston and giving examples of the speciﬁ c diseases that have been menƟ oned. \\nAnnouncer: This is Natalie CasƟ ngs and the radio programme “Be Healthy, Wealthy and Wise”. Today in the studio we have Professor \\nLivingston. Hello, Professor, I’ve learnt that over 2,000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates was the ﬁ rst to begin categorizing \\ndiseases in a scienƟ ﬁ c way and this pracƟ ce conƟ nues into modern Ɵ mes. \\nProfessor: Hello, Natalie, yes, today we have a disease classiﬁ caƟ on system presented by the World Health OrganizaƟ on that can be \\nsummarized in ten broad areas. To start with, the ﬁ rst one includes Heart, Lung and Other Organ Diseases. Currently it is known that \\nthe number one killer is heart disease. Heart a Ʃ acks, coronary heart disease and conges Ɵ ve heart failure are all very common and \\nlung diseases such as chronic obstrucƟ ve pulmonary disease is another major cause of deaths. \\nAnnouncer: The staƟ sƟ cs are undoubtedly grave. Are the causes of these ailments known today, Professor Livingston? \\nProfessor: Yes, the causes of these ailments, as well as those of other organs typically include inherited condi Ɵ ons, infecƟ ons and \\ntrauma. Well, if I can speak about the second category of diseases, it will include Blood and Immune System Diseases . I have some \\nstaƟ sƟ cs here, if I may…\\nAnnouncer: Yes, Professor, please. StaƟ sƟ cs will help us to get a beƩ er picture of the situaƟ on that we have today.\\nProfessor: All right then. It has recently been reported that anaemia was named the leading reason for more than 200,000 emergency \\nroom visits and nearly 400,000 hospitalizaƟ ons. The NaƟ onal InsƟ tutes of Health has noted that about ﬁ ve to eight percent are aﬀ ected \\nby an autoimmune disease. Among the most prevalent are type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthriƟ s and psoriasis. \\nAnnouncer: Are the causes of these ailments the same as for the Heart, Lung and Other Organ Diseases?\\nProfessor: Well, not exactly. The immune system problems may be congenital or, as in the case of AIDS, acquired.\\nAnnouncer: So the causes of Heart, Lung and Other Organ Diseases  typically include inherited condi Ɵ ons, infecƟ ons and trauma. \\nMeanwhile, the causes of Blood and Immune System Diseases may be congenital or acquired. I can see the diﬀ erence now… OK, so \\nwe can move to the third category now.\\nProfessor: The third category includes only one, yet very common disease – Cancer. Although breast cancer is the most common \\ncancer found in women and prostate cancer the most common in men, lung cancer is the deadliest. Sta Ɵ sƟ cally, lung cancer is the \\ntop cause of cancer deaths in both sexes.\\nAnnouncer: Yes, it is one of the major causes of deaths in the whole world. If I am not mistaken, cancer is in the second place as a \\ncause of death.'),\n",

Well, let’s go to the next category of diseases, which includes Injuries. StaƟ sƟ cally, injury ranks ﬁ rst as \\na killer of persons aged one to 44.\\nAnnouncer: Do you mean that the risk for injury varies with age? \\nProfessor: Yes, the risk varies with age. For example, poisoning is a par Ɵ cular hazard for toddlers while older adults are at a higher \\nrisk of fall-related injuries. Meanwhile, motor vehicle crashes conƟ nue to threaten all age groups. \\nAnnouncer: Yes, that sounds about right. It’s so obvious now that the risk of injury varies with age. All right. And now we can move \\non. So what is next in the categorizaƟ on?\\nProfessor: Well, the ﬁ Ō h category includes Brain and Nervous System Diseases.\\nAnnouncer: Does the risk vary with age within this category too? \\nProfessor: In fact brain and nervous system illnesses can appear at any age. Spina bi ﬁ da, which is associated with inadequate folic \\nacid intake in a pregnant woman’s diet is present at birth. Alzheimer’s demenƟ a, like schizophrenia, arises in adults, has a gene Ɵ c \\ncomponent and is associated with physical changes in the brain.\\nAnnouncer: So, I can see that it’s not that obvious in terms of age as it was with the  Injuries category, but anyway we can see that \\ncertain diseases are age-related, for example, Spina biﬁ da, which is present at birth, or Alzheimer’s demenƟ a, which typically arises \\nin adults. That’s interesƟ ng. And now what diseases can be found in the sixth category?\\nProfessor: These are Endocrine System Diseases. We know that endocrine glands secrete hormones into the bloodstream with wide-\\nranging eﬀ ects. \\nAnnouncer: Yes, but could you, please, be more speci ﬁ c and give some examples here, Professor, to make it more understandable \\nfor me and our listeners.\\nProfessor: Yes, of course, Natalie. For example, diabetes occurs when insulin from the pancreas can no longer e ﬀ ecƟ vely regulate \\nglucose. Cushing’s disease of the adrenal glands and hyperthyroidism are also endocrine disorders. Is it any clearer now?\\nAnnouncer: Yes, a liƩ le bit, Professor. So all this means that endocrine system disorders may result in wide-ranging e ﬀ ects in a hu-\\nman body.\\nProfessor: Yes, Natalie, you are absolutely right. And, now the seventh category… It includes InfecƟ ous and ParasiƟ c Diseases.\\nAnnouncer: Well, I know that historically infecƟ ous diseases such as tuberculosis, cholera or yellow fever have played a major role \\nin human health. \\nProfessor: Yes. And even today, according to the NaƟ onal InsƟ tutes of Health, more people die worldwide of infecƟ ous diseases than \\nof any other cause. Bacteria, viruses and parasites all contribute to this toll.\\nAnnouncer: Yes, it sounds about right that now more people die of infec Ɵ ous diseases than of any other cause, bearing in mind all \\nthese current major threats of contagious diseases such as HIV, Sars or Ebola. \\nProfessor: Yes, including that same tuberculosis you’ve menƟ oned earlier. OK. And now, Natalie, let’s move to the eighth category of \\ndiseases. This one includes Pregnancy and Childbirth-Related Diseases. The number of babies from those born alive and who survive \\nto age one, is a criƟ cal health measure. \\nAnnouncer: But I’m sure that nowadays infant mortality rates have changed considerably for the beƩ er. \\nProfessor: Well, yes. But sƟ ll more than one-third of these deaths, staƟ sƟ cally, are related to premature birth, which is oŌ en related \\nto other problems during pregnancy. \\nAnnouncer: That’s a sad staƟ sƟ c, Professor Livingston. But I believe this is the worldwide staƟ sƟ c and the situaƟ on with the prema-\\nture birth-related problems would be less threatening if we spoke of the western part of the world where medical services are beƩ er \\ndeveloped. \\nProfessor: Yes, Natalie, this is indeed a worldwide staƟ sƟ c. In fact, professional medical services, including prevenƟ ve measures and \\nearly diagnosƟ cs for diseases add to a much more promising situaƟ on regarding premature birth-related problems and lower mortality \\nrates. Well… and now, shall we move the ninth category of disease? \\nAnnouncer: Yes, please, Professor. What diseases does the ninth category involve? \\nProfessor: Well, Inherited Diseases would go to this category.\\nAnnouncer: So, these would be the diseases related to the geneƟ c abnormaliƟ es. Is that true, Professor?\\nProfessor: Yes, Natalie. Inherited diseases can be the result of a single gene abnormality -- such as Down’s syndrome -- or from the \\ninterplay of mulƟ ple genes. For instance, neural tube defects and hip dysplasia involve mulƟ ple genes.\\nAnnouncer: All this sounds rather complicated and severe, Professor. But we can understand that Inherited Diseases are any of the \\ndiseases and disorders that are caused by mutaƟ ons in one or more genes. Well, although you’ve menƟ oned so many diseases, there \\nis sƟ ll one more category leŌ . So what are the diseases that would belong to the tenth category?\\nProfessor: These would be Environmentally-Acquired Diseases. \\nAnnouncer: Then these must be the diseases related to the immediate changes in the environment, for example, exposure to the \\nsun or cold. Am I right, Professor? \\nProfessor: Not exactly, Natalie. Yes, environmental health e ﬀ ects can be immediate, such as heat wave-related deaths or carbon \\nmonoxide poisoning. But others, such as skin cancer take years to evolve. And others may only show up in later generaƟ ons, such as \\nhaemophilia, asthma or schizophrenia.\\nAnnouncer:  Well, I see that my understanding of various diseases and their causes has been very limited un Ɵ l now. And I really \\nappreciate that you could ﬁ nd some Ɵ me in your busy schedule to come to the studio today to share this interes Ɵ ng and valuable \\ninformaƟ on. I hope it was none the less useful to our listeners to learn about…'),\n",

IdenƟ fy useful words / phrases and their mean-\\nings used in the text from the list of words provided in Listening 1 above. Then answer the quesƟ ons below.\\nAnswer the quesƟ ons below according to the text above:\\n1. What is considered a disease and what is not considered a disease?\\n A disease is a par Ɵ cular abnormal condiƟ on, a disorder of a structure or funcƟ on that aﬀ ects part or all of an organism. Disease \\nis oŌ en construed as a medical condiƟ on associated with speciﬁ c symptoms and signs. \\n Commonly, the term disease is used to refer speciﬁ cally to infecƟ ous diseases, which are clinically evident diseases that result from \\nthe presence of pathogenic microbial agents, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, mul Ɵ cellular organisms and aberrant \\nproteins known as prions. An infec Ɵ on that does not and will not produce clinically evident impairment of normal func Ɵ oning, \\nsuch as the presence of the normal bacteria and yeasts in the gut, or of a passenger virus, is not considered a disease. By contrast, \\nan infecƟ on that is asymptomaƟ c during its incubaƟ on period, but expected to produce symptoms later, is usually considered a \\ndisease.\\n2. What are typical causes of disease? \\n It may be caused by factors origina Ɵ ng from an external source, such as infec Ɵ ous disease, or it may be caused by internal dys-\\nfuncƟ ons, such as autoimmune diseases.\\n3. How do diseases typically a ﬀ ect people?\\n Diseases usually a ﬀ ect people not only physically, but also emo Ɵ onally, as contracƟ ng and living with a disease can alter one’s \\nperspecƟ ve on life, and one’s personality.\\n4. What is the di ﬀ erence between infecƟ ous diseases and non-infecƟ ous diseases? \\n Infec Ɵ ous diseases are clinically evident diseases that result from the presence of pathogenic microbial agents, including viruses, \\nbacteria, fungi, protozoa, mulƟ cellular organisms and aberrant proteins known as prions. Non-infec Ɵ ous diseases are all other \\ndiseases, including most forms of cancer, heart disease and geneƟ c disease.\\nREADING 2\\nRead the informaƟ on about the stages of disease and their peculiariƟ es (adapted from Disease). Insert the right stages of disease \\nin the gaps from the table below. Make sure you know the correct pronuncia Ɵ on of the stages of disease. Iden Ɵ fy other useful \\nwords and phrases from the list of words provided in Listening 1.\\nIn an infecƟ ous disease, the incubaƟ on period is the Ɵ me between infecƟ on and the appearance of symptoms. The latency period is \\nthe Ɵ me between infecƟ on and the ability of the disease to spread to another person, which may precede, follow, or be simultaneous \\nwith the appearance of symptoms. Some viruses also exhibit a dormant phase, called viral latency, in which the virus hides in t he \\nbody in an inacƟ ve state. For example, varicella zoster virus causes chickenpox in the acute phase; aŌ er recovery from chickenpox, \\nthe virus may remain dormant in nerve cells for many years, and later cause herpes zoster (shingles).\\nAn acute disease is a short-lived disease, like the common cold.\\nA chronic disease is one that lasts for a long Ɵ me, usually at least six months. During that Ɵ me, it may be constantly present, or it \\nmay go into remission and periodically relapse. A chronic disease may be stable (does not get any worse) or it may be progressive \\n(gets worse over Ɵ me). Some chronic diseases can be permanently cured. Most chronic diseases can be beneﬁ cially treated, even \\nif they cannot be permanently cured.\\nA ﬂ are-up can refer to either the recurrence of symptoms or an onset of more severe symptoms.\\nA refractory disease is a disease that resists treatment, especially an individual case that resists treatment more than is normal for \\nthe speciﬁ c disease in quesƟ on.\\nA progressive disease is a disease whose typical natural course is the worsening of the disease unƟ l death, serious debility or organ \\nfailure occurs. Slowly progressive diseases are also chronic diseases; many are also degeneraƟ ve diseases. The opposite of progres-\\nsive disease is stable disease or staƟ c disease: a medical condiƟ on that exists, but does not get beƩ er or worse.\\nA cure is the end of a medical condi Ɵ on or a treatment that is very likely to end it, while remission refers to the disappearance, \\npossibly temporarily, of symptoms. Complete remission is the best possible outcome for incurable diseases.\\nA clinical disease  is one that has clinical consequences, i.e., the stage of the disease that produces the characteris Ɵ c signs and \\nsymptoms of that disease. AIDS is the clinical disease stage of HIV infecƟ on.\\nA subclinical disease is also called silent disease, silent stage, or asymptomaƟ c disease.

Feel \\nfree to use the TranslaƟ onDirectory.com (hƩ p://goo.gl/a7zB0O) for your analysis.\\n\\u20021. Atherosclerosis = athero- (related to faƩ y deposit, soŌ  gruel-like deposit) + -sclerosis (hardening). So, the term Atheroscle-\\nrosis denotes a medical condiƟ on when faƩ y substances form a deposit thus causing hardening (of the arteries). \\n\\u20022. Dysthymia = dys- (related to bad, diﬃ  cult, abnormal condiƟ on) + -thymia (emoƟ ons). So, the term Dysthymia denotes a medical \\ncondiƟ on related to abnormal emoƟ onal condiƟ on or mood disorder (known as chronic depression).\\n\\u20023. Hydrocephalus = hydro- (related to water) + cephal(o)- (related to the head (as a whole)). So, the term Hydrocephalus denotes \\na medical condiƟ on when water (or ﬂ uid) builds up in the head (on the brain).\\n\\u20024. Hypertension = hyper- (denotes something as ’extreme’ or ’beyond normal’) + -tension (pressure). So, the term Hypertension \\ndenotes a medical condiƟ on known as high blood pressure (HBP).\\n\\u20025. Tachycardia = tachy- (denoƟ ng something as fast, irregularly fast) + -cardio (of or pertaining to the heart). So, the term Tachy-\\ncardia denotes a medical condiƟ on in which a heart rate exceeds the normal resƟ ng rate. \\n\\u20026. Thrombocytopenia = thrombo- (of or relaƟ ng to a blood clot, cloƫ  ng of blood) + -cyto- (cell) + -penia (deﬁ ciency). So, the term \\nThrombocytopenia denotes a medical condiƟ on in which there is a deﬁ ciency of blood cells involved in forming blood clots. \\n\\u20027. Galactorrhea = galacto- (milk) + -rrhoea  (ﬂ owing, discharge). So, the term Galactorrhea denotes a discharge of milk (from \\na nipple, e.g. in women who are not breasƞ eeding an infant).\\n\\u20028. Stomatogastric = stomato- (of or pertaining to the mouth) + gastro- (of or pertaining to the stomach). So, the term Stomato-\\ngastric denotes a medical condiƟ on related to the mouth and the stomach.\\n\\u20029. Pseudohypertrophy = pseudo- (denotes something false or fake) + hyper- (denotes something as ’extreme’ or ’beyond normal’) + \\n-trophy (nourishment, development). So, the term Pseudohypertrophy denotes falsely enlargement of organs (e.g. calf muscles, \\nwhich become swollen with deposits of fat and ﬁ brous Ɵ ssue).\\n10. Bronchiectasis = bronch(i)- (of or relaƟ ng to the bronchus) + -ectasis (expansion, dilaƟ on). So, the term Bronchiectasis denotes \\na medical condiƟ on in which an area of the bronchial tubes is (permanently and abnormally) dilated. \\nLANGUAGE FOCUS 4\\nFill in the missing leƩ ers in the following words.\\n1.

Some of the diseases it can cause include: meningitis (an infection of the coverings of the brain), epiglottitis (an infection of the upper throat and entrance of the windpipe), cellulitis (an infection of the deep tissues, especially of the face and neck), septic arthritis (an infection and swelling of the joints), pneumonia (an infection of the lung), and bacteremia (blood stream) infections.\\nWho gets this disease?\\nThis illness is primarily seen in unimmunized children under four years of age. Children under age two are most susceptible because their immune systems are not yet able to fight the bacteria. Rarely, older children and adults may develop infection.\\nIt appears that in a setting such as the household or childcare facility – where there are young children and everyone is in close contact – there is an increased risk of one of these contacts developing Hib infection following a first case.\\nHow is it spread?\\nThe bacterium is passed from person-to-person by breathing in infected droplets of nose or throat fluids scattered in the air or by direct contact with these infected secretions. The bacteria cannot live on environmental surfaces – they quickly shrivel and die.\\nLike meningococcus, some people can “carry” this bacterium for a period of time without it causing illness. However, a carrier may spread the bacteria to another person who may then become ill. In a household or childcare center in which Hib infection has occurred, the number of persons with nose or throat carriage is greatly increased; thus, risk of serious disease is also increased.\\nHow is it diagnosed and treated?\\nIllnesses caused by Haemophilus influenzae type-b are diagnosed by signs and symptoms and by examining the blood and/or spinal fluid for white blood cells and bacteria. Spinal fluid is obtained by a physician performing a lumbar puncture (i.e., spinal tap).\\nHow can the spread of this disease be prevented?\\n1. If a person develops an illness caused by Hib, close contacts of this patient (including family members and persons having intimate contact such as sleeping together, hugging and kissing) are at increased risk of developing the illness. In this situation a physician may recommend: 1) carefully watching for early symptoms of illness caused by Haemophilus influenzae and/or 2) taking a preventive antibiotic to eliminate the bacteria from the body before disease begins.\\n2. Any child or adult contact that develops symptoms consistent with Hib infection requires evaluation by a heath care provider regardless of whether or not this person has taken preventive antibiotics.\\n3. A vaccination against Hib infection is available and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all children begin the vaccine series against Hib infection at two months of age. The four dose series should be completed at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12-15 months.disease is an illness caused by a virus called human parvovirus B19. Although people may be asymptomatic with the illness, most children with it develop a facial rash (i.e., “slapped check” appearance) and a lace-like rash on the trunk and extremities. The rash may reappear for several weeks following exposure to non-specific stimuli such as sunlight, change in temperature or emotional stress.\\nExcept for the rash, the patient is typically otherwise well: but some give a history of mild general symptoms one to four days before rash onset. Fever, sore throat or pain and swelling in the joints may also occur.\\nWho gets this disease?\\nAlthough most commonly recognized in children, anyone is susceptible. Studies indicate previous infection with Fifth disease correlates with a lower risk of a second infection. Outbreaks in schools often begin in late winter or early spring and may continue until the school year is over.\\nIn the U.S. about 50% of the adult population are already immune to the disease. Some studies indicate the pregnant women who are exposed to Fifth disease and subsequently develop infection may have an increased risk for fetal death. However, this risk is felt to be extremely low. There is no evidence that the infection during pregnancy causes fetal malformations (i.e., birth defects). Pregnant childcare workers should contact their obstetricians.\\nHow is it spread?\\nThe virus that causes Fifth disease has been found in the respiratory secretions of patients and is, therefore, most likely spread by direct person-to-person contact through the respiratory route.\\nHow soon do symptoms appear?\\nIt takes from 4-21 days after exposure to develop the characteristic rash illness of Fifth disease.\\nPeople with the rash are past the period of infectiousness to others. The highest risk of transmitting the Fifth disease virus to others is felt to occur before the rash develops.\\nHow is it diagnosed and treated?\\nA healthcare provider based on the characteristic rash and any other accompanying symptoms may diagnose Fifth disease. There is no specific treatment for Fifth disease.\\nHow can the spread of this disease be prevented?\\n1. Because transmission of the Fifth disease virus usually occurs before the rash develops – when a child may seem well or has a non-specific illness – excluding children with the Fifth disease rash is of no proven value. However, it is very important for a healthcare provider to rule out other rash-causing illnesses (e.g., measles, chickenpox) that may require exclusion from childcare.\\n2.

The infectious form of the parasite is passed in the stool of an infected individual.\\nWho gets this disease?\\nAnyone can get Giardiasis. It is very common in childcare centers; especially those that have children under age three. It spreads easily among these children to their caretakers and families.\\nHow is it spread?\\nThe most common way a person becomes infected with giardia in the childcare setting is by the fecal-oral route. Eating food contaminated with the parasite may also infect a person. Food may become contaminated when the person preparing the food has giardiasis and has some infected stool on his/her hands because of poor hand washing habits.\\nAdditionally, a person may become infected by drinking water that is contaminated with the parasite. Streams, ponds and springs in New Hampshire are frequently contaminated with giardiasis parasites. Water can also be contaminated with giardia when sewage enters the drinking water supply.\\nWhat are the symptoms?\\nThe most common symptoms of a giardia infection are diarrhea, abdominal pain, cramping, decreased appetite and excess gas. There is usually no fever or vomiting. The diarrhea may last up to several months and can cause significant weight loss.\\nHow soon do the symptoms appear?\\nThe symptoms appear within 5-25 days or longer. The average incubation period is 1-3 weeks.\\nCan a person have this disease without knowing it?\\nYes. Some people may have very mild infections that are not serious enough to cause them to go to a doctor. They may not feel sick at all. In some cases of giardia infection, parasites can be found in the stool from several days to several months after the symptoms have stopped.\\nWhat is the treatment?\\nSeveral drugs are effective in killing the giardia parasite. Treatment is usually necessary for persons with diarrhea.\\nHow can the spread of this disease be prevented?\\n1. Wash hands thoroughly after using the toilet and diapering a child.\\n2. Wash hands thoroughly before preparing food.\\n3. Keep children who have diarrhea at home.\\n4. Staff with stool positive for giardia should not prepare food or feed children.\\nWho should be excluded?\\nAny person with diarrhea shall be excluded from food handling, from childcare agencies and from direct care of hospitalized or institutionalized patients until 48 hours after resolution of symptoms\\nReportable?\\nYes, giardiasis is reportable by New Hampshire law to the Division of Public Health Services, Bureau of Infectious Disease Control at (603) 271-4496'),\n",

Water can also be contaminated with giardia when sewage enters the drinking water supply.\\nWhat are the symptoms?\\nThe most common symptoms of a giardia infection are diarrhea, abdominal pain, cramping, decreased appetite and excess gas. There is usually no fever or vomiting. The diarrhea may last up to several months and can cause significant weight loss.\\nHow soon do the symptoms appear?\\nThe symptoms appear within 5-25 days or longer. The average incubation period is 1-3 weeks.\\nCan a person have this disease without knowing it?\\nYes. Some people may have very mild infections that are not serious enough to cause them to go to a doctor. They may not feel sick at all. In some cases of giardia infection, parasites can be found in the stool from several days to several months after the symptoms have stopped.\\nWhat is the treatment?\\nSeveral drugs are effective in killing the giardia parasite. Treatment is usually necessary for persons with diarrhea.\\nHow can the spread of this disease be prevented?\\n1. Wash hands thoroughly after using the toilet and diapering a child.\\n2. Wash hands thoroughly before preparing food.\\n3. Keep children who have diarrhea at home.\\n4. Staff with stool positive for giardia should not prepare food or feed children.\\nWho should be excluded?\\nAny person with diarrhea shall be excluded from food handling, from childcare agencies and from direct care of hospitalized or institutionalized patients until 48 hours after resolution of symptoms\\nReportable?\\nYes, giardiasis is reportable by New Hampshire law to the Division of Public Health Services, Bureau of Infectious Disease Control at (603) 271-4496')]"

       "'bacterium that causes serious, sometimes fatal illnesses, most often in young children. Some of the diseases it can cause include: meningitis (an infection of the coverings of the brain), epiglottitis (an infection of the upper throat and entrance of the windpipe), cellulitis (an infection of the deep tissues, especially of the face and neck), septic arthritis (an infection and swelling of the joints), pneumonia (an infection of the lung), and bacteremia (blood stream) infections.\\nWho gets this disease?\\nThis illness is primarily seen in unimmunized children under four years of age. Children under age two are most susceptible because their immune systems are not yet able to fight the bacteria. Rarely, older children and adults may develop infection.\\nIt appears that in a setting such as the household or childcare facility – where there are young children and everyone is in close contact – there is an increased risk of one of these contacts developing Hib infection following a first case.\\nHow is it spread?\\nThe bacterium is passed from person-to-person by breathing in infected droplets of nose or throat fluids scattered in the air or by direct contact with these infected secretions. The bacteria cannot live on environmental surfaces – they quickly shrivel and die.\\nLike meningococcus, some people can “carry” this bacterium for a period of time without it causing illness. However, a carrier may spread the bacteria to another person who may then become ill. In a household or childcare center in which Hib infection has occurred, the number of persons with nose or throat carriage is greatly increased; thus, risk of serious disease is also increased.\\nHow is it diagnosed and treated?\\nIllnesses caused by Haemophilus influenzae type-b are diagnosed by signs and symptoms and by examining the blood and/or spinal fluid for white blood cells and bacteria. Spinal fluid is obtained by a physician performing a lumbar puncture (i.e., spinal tap).\\nHow can the spread of this disease be prevented?\\n1. If a person develops an illness caused by Hib, close contacts of this patient (including family members and persons having intimate contact such as sleeping together, hugging and kissing) are at increased risk of developing the illness. In this situation a physician may recommend: 1) carefully watching for early symptoms of illness caused by Haemophilus influenzae and/or 2) taking a preventive antibiotic to eliminate the bacteria from the body before disease begins.\\n2. Any child or adult contact that develops symptoms consistent with Hib infection requires evaluation by a heath care provider regardless of whether or not this person has taken preventive antibiotics.\\n3. A vaccination against Hib infection is available and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all children begin the vaccine series against Hib infection at two months of age. The four dose series should be completed at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12-15 months.disease is an illness caused by a virus called human parvovirus B19. Although people may be asymptomatic with the illness, most children with it develop a facial rash (i.e., “slapped check” appearance) and a lace-like rash on the trunk and extremities. The rash may reappear for several weeks following exposure to non-specific stimuli such as sunlight, change in temperature or emotional stress.\\nExcept for the rash, the patient is typically otherwise well: but some give a history of mild general symptoms one to four days before rash onset. Fever, sore throat or pain and swelling in the joints may also occur.\\nWho gets this disease?\\nAlthough most commonly recognized in children, anyone is susceptible. Studies indicate previous infection with Fifth disease correlates with a lower risk of a second infection. Outbreaks in schools often begin in late winter or early spring and may continue until the school year is over.\\nIn the U.S. about 50% of the adult population are already immune to the disease. Some studies indicate the pregnant women who are exposed to Fifth disease and subsequently develop infection may have an increased risk for fetal death. However, this risk is felt to be extremely low. There is no evidence that the infection during pregnancy causes fetal malformations (i.e., birth defects). Pregnant childcare workers should contact their obstetricians.\\nHow is it spread?\\nThe virus that causes Fifth disease has been found in the respiratory secretions of patients and is, therefore, most likely spread by direct person-to-person contact through the respiratory route.\\nHow soon do symptoms appear?\\nIt takes from 4-21 days after exposure to develop the characteristic rash illness of Fifth disease.\\nPeople with the rash are past the period of infectiousness to others. The highest risk of transmitting the Fifth disease virus to others is felt to occur before the rash develops.\\nHow is it diagnosed and treated?\\nA healthcare provider based on the characteristic rash and any other accompanying symptoms may diagnose Fifth disease. There is no specific treatment for Fifth disease.\\nHow can the spread of this disease be prevented?\\n1. Because transmission of the Fifth disease virus usually occurs before the rash develops – when a child may seem well or has a non-specific illness – excluding children with the Fifth disease rash is of no proven value. However, it is very important for a healthcare provider to rule out other rash-causing illnesses (e.g., measles, chickenpox) that may require exclusion from childcare.\\n2. Transmission of infection can be lessened by routine hygienic practices for control of respiratory infections, which include hand washing and disposal of facial tissues containing respiratory secretions.\\n3. People with particular concerns about contracting Fifth disease (e.g., pregnant women) should consult their healthcare providers.'"
